# DeepVeritas

A next-generation data validation and verification platform powered by modular agents and real-time cross-checking.

## Technical Blueprint
Version 1.0

### 1. Problem Statement

#### Current Challenges in Data Management:

- Fragmented data sources with inconsistent validation
- Manual verification processes causing delays (avg. 48hrs/update)
- No unified system for automated fact-checking across structured/unstructured data
- Growing regulatory demands (GDPR, CCPA) require auditable data lineage

#### What Existing Tools Miss:
❌ Rule-based systems (Great Expectations) lack semantic understanding  
❌ Static databases can't handle real-time updates from 100+ sources  
❌ No built-in human oversight for critical decisions  

### 2. Core Functionality

| Feature | Description | Key Benefit |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Modular Agents | Hot-swappable Docker containers for data tasks | Add new data sources in <15 mins |
| Real-Time Validation | Cross-check against 3+ sources using NLP models | 90% reduction in data errors |
| Knowledge Graph | Store relationships (Company→Patent→Research) for contextual queries | Complex queries 10x faster than SQL |
| Automation Workflows | Drag-and-drop UI to chain agents (Scrape → Validate → Store → Alert) | Non-coders build pipelines |
| Human-in-the-Loop | Flag uncertain results for review via Slack/MS Teams | Compliance-ready audit trails |
